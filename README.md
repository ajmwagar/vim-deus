# vim-dues

Dues was created out of sheer rage caused by all of the bad Solarized/Gruvbox clones.
I was tired of them. I needed something original, something new. So if you are like me...
which I believe many of you are, 

I present you **Dues**

## Thank You
I took **a lot** of inspiration from two great colorschemes,
[Onedark](https://github.com/joshdick/onedark.vim) and
[Gruvbox](https://github.com/morhetz/gruvbox). I want to thank their creators for making
such great color schemes. So thank you.
